-You can chain a method in a sentence when the previous method called returns `ActiveRecord::Relation`,
-like `all`, `where`, and `joins`. Methods that returns a instance of a single object

-There are some examples below. This guide won't cover all the possibilities, just a few as example.
-When a Active Record method is called, the query is not immediately generated and sent to the database,
