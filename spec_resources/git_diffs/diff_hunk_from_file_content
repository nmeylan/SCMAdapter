 +The Active Record pattern implements [Method Chaining](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_chaining),
 +which allow us to use multiple Active Record methods together in a simple and straightforward way.

-You can chain a method in a sentence when the previous method called returns `ActiveRecord::Relation`,
-like `all`, `where`, and `joins`. Methods that returns a instance of a single object
-(see [Retrieving a Single Object Section](#retrieving-a-single-object)) have to be be the last
-in the sentence.

-There are some examples below. This guide won't cover all the possibilities, just a few as example.
-When a Active Record method is called, the query is not immediately generated and sent to the database,
-this just happen when the data is actually needed. So each example below generate a single query.
